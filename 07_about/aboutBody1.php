Furthermore, Epenclass offers a rich library of practice materials and test-prep materials for specialized markets, ensuring students have access to highly relevant learning content in the palm of their hand.

	<h5 class="col-lg-10">What Is Epenclass for Teachers?</h5>
	<p class="col-lg-9">Epenclass is an all-in-one educational powerhouse for organizing your class and completing day-to-day learning tasks. Integrating digital handwriting and share-editing, Epenclass enables students and teachers to work over the internet as if they are side by side, in the same room, writing on the same piece of paper. In-app tools allow instructors to selectively release an answer key to students, and view it themselves for expedient grading. Digital scrap paper provides students a quick way to do extra work right beside their main worksheet. That’s not to mention built-in calculators, graphing tools, and countless other learning instruments. EpenClass helps subvert the question “when am I ever going to use this in real life?” and instead has students asking “what’s stopping me from being better than I was yesterday?”.</p>
